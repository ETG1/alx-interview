# Prime Game

## Description
Maria and Ben are playing a game involving prime numbers. They take turns selecting a prime number from a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 to n, and then removing that prime number along with its multiples. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

This project simulates multiple rounds of the game, where `n` may differ in each round, and determines who wins the most rounds.

## Files
- `0-prime_game.py`: Contains the logic to simulate the game and determine the winner.
- `main_0.py`: Script to test the functionality of the game simulation.

## Usage
Run the script to see the winner of the game:

```bash
./main_0.py
